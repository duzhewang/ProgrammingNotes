SQL:

```
Select T1.sub_id as post_id, coalesce(T2.number_of_comments, 0) as number_of_comments from 
(Select distinct sub_id 
from Submissions 
where parent_id is Null) as T1
left join
(SELECT parent_id, COUNT(DISTINCT sub_id) AS number_of_comments
    FROM Submissions
    WHERE parent_id IS NOT NULL
    GROUP BY parent_id ) as T2
on T1.sub_id=T2.parent_id
order by post_id asc;  

```

- COALESCE(val1, val2, ...., val_n): returns the first non-null value in a list
