select
    a.visited_on,
    sum(b.tot) as amount,
    round(avg(b.tot),2) as average_amount
from
    (select distinct visited_on from Customer) a
    left join
    (select visited_on, sum(amount) as tot
    from Customer
    group by visited_on) b
on
    datediff(a.visited_on, b.visited_on) <= 6
    and
    a.visited_on >= b.visited_on
group by
    a.visited_on
