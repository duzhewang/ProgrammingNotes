Problem: [Active users](https://leetcode.com/problems/active-users/)

MySQL:

```
Select distinct A.id, Acc.name from 
(select id, login_date,
lead(login_date,4) over (partition by id order by login_date) as lead_date
from 
(select distinct id, login_date from Logins) as B
) as A
join Accounts as Acc
on A.id=Acc.id
where A.lead_date=ADDDATE(A.login_date, interval 4 day)
order by A.id; 

```

- Key idea: use window function `lead`: https://www.sqlservertutorial.net/sql-server-window-functions/sql-server-lead-function/
