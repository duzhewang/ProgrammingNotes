Lesson 2: [Functions and getting help](https://www.kaggle.com/colinmorris/functions-and-getting-help)

- ```help()```

- Defining functions: Functions start with a header introduced by the ```def``` keyword. 
The indented block of code following the ```:``` is run when the function is called.
```return``` is another keyword uniquely associated with functions. When Python encounters a ```return``` statement, it exits the function immediately, 
and passes the value on the right hand side to the calling context. For example, 

```
def least_difference(a, b, c):
    """
    Return the smallest difference between any two numbers
    among a, b and c.
    
    >>> least_difference(1, 5, -5)
    4
    """
    
    diff1 = abs(a - b)
    diff2 = abs(b - c)
    diff3 = abs(a - c)
    return min(diff1, diff2, diff3)
```

The text between ```"""``` and ```"""``` is called docstring.
