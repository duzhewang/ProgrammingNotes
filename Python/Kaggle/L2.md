Lesson 2: [Functions and getting help](https://www.kaggle.com/colinmorris/functions-and-getting-help)

- ```help()```

- Defining functions: Functions start with a header introduced by the ```def``` keyword. 
The indented block of code following the ```:``` is run when the function is called.
```return``` is another keyword uniquely associated with functions. When Python encounters a ```return``` statement, it exits the function immediately, 
and passes the value on the right hand side to the calling context.
