## Lesson 3: [Booleans and conditionals](https://www.kaggle.com/colinmorris/booleans-and-conditionals)

- Python has a type of variable called ```bool```. It has two possible values: ```True``` and ```False```

- Boolean conversion: 

```
print(bool(1)) # all numbers are treated as true, except 0
print(bool(0))
print(bool("asf")) # all strings are treated as true, except the empty string ""
print(bool(""))
# Generally empty sequences (strings, lists, and other types we've yet to see like lists and tuples)
# are "falsey" and the rest are "truthy"

```

- ```Int(True)``` returns 1; ```Int(False)``` returns 0
