## Lesson 4: [Lists](https://www.kaggle.com/colinmorris/lists)

- List in Python represent ordered sequences of values. 

- Python uses zero-based indexing, so the first element has index 0. 

- Elements at the end of the list can be assessed with negative numbers, starting from -1. 

- In short, objects carry some things around with them. You acess that stuff using Python's dot syntax.
