# SQL syntax

- Database Tables

A database most often contains one or more tables. Each table is identified by a name (e.g. "Customers" or "Orders"). Tables contain records (rows) with data.

- SQL Statements

Most of the actions you need to perform on a database are done with SQL statements. For example, 

```
select * from customers
```
