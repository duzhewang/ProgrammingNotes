## Problems which need more practice
- Average Population of Each Continent: use ```floor```
- Draw the triangle 1
- Draw the triangle 2
- Weather Observation Station 17
- Weather Observation Station 20
- Occupations
- Challenges
- SQL project planning



## Unsolved problems: 
- Print prime numbers 
- 15 days of learning SQL


## Notes 

- ```len()```: length function  in MS SQL server
- ```length()```: length function in mySQL
- ```like```: select pattern
- ```round()``` function is used in MySQL
- ```right(string, 3)```: **last three characters of the string**
- ```left(string, 1)```: the first character of the string
- ```replace(1203, "0", "")```: replace 1203 with 123. 
- ```floor()```: round down to the nearest integer
- ```concat(expression1, expression2,...)```: concatenate all expressions
- ```lower(STRING)```: lower case of STRING
- ```power(number, 2)```: number squared
- ```Datediff(day, start_date, end_date)```
- ```union```
