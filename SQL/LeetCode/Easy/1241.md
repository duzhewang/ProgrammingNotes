SQL:

```
Select T1.sub_id as post_id, coalesce(T2.number_of_comments, 0) as number_of_comments from 
(Select distinct sub_id 
from Submissions 
where parent_id is Null) as T1
left join
(SELECT parent_id, COUNT(DISTINCT sub_id) AS number_of_comments
    FROM Submissions
    WHERE parent_id IS NOT NULL
    GROUP BY parent_id ) as T2
on T1.sub_id=T2.parent_id
order by post_id asc;  

```

- COALESCE(val1, val2, ...., val_n): returns the first non-null value in a list




```

Select distinct S1.sub_id as post_id, count(distinct S2.sub_id) as number_of_comments from Submissions as S1
left join Submissions as S2
on S1.sub_id=S2.parent_id
where S1.parent_id is null
group by S1.sub_id;
