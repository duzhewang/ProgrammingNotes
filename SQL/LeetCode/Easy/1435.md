Problem: [Create a Session Bar Chart](https://leetcode.com/problems/create-a-session-bar-chart/)

SQL:
```
select '[0-5>' as bin, count(1) as total
from Sessions
where duration>=0 and duration < 300
union
select '[5-10>' as bin, count(1) as total
from Sessions
where duration>=300 and duration < 600
union
select '[10-15>' as bin, count(1) as total
from Sessions
where duration>=600 and duration < 900
union
select '15 or more' as bin, count(1) as total
from Sessions
where duration >= 900      
       
```

- Note: using `union` is good since we need to include every group even the count of some group is 0.
