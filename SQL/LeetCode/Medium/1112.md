Problem: Highest Grade For Each Student

MySQL:

```
SELECT student_id, MIN(course_id) course_id, grade
FROM Enrollments
WHERE (student_id, grade) IN 
        (SELECT student_id, MAX(grade) 
        FROM Enrollments
        GROUP BY student_id)
GROUP BY student_id
ORDER BY student_id;
```


SQL:

```
Select E.student_id, min(E.course_id) as course_id, E.grade from Enrollments as E
join (
Select student_id, max(grade) as max_grade from Enrollments 
group by student_id) as T
on E.student_id=T.student_id and E.grade=T.max_grade
group by E.student_id, E.grade
order by E.student_id asc;
