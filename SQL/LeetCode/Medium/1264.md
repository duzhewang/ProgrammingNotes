Problem: Page Recommendations

SQL:

```
Select distinct page_id as recommended_page from Likes where user_id in
(select user2_id
    from Friendship
    where user1_id=1
    union
    select user1_id
    from Friendship
    where user2_id=1) 
    and page_id not in 
    (Select page_id from Likes where user_id=1);
```


- Remark: use ```union``` to concatenate two sequences. 



```
(Select L1.page_id as recommended_page from Friendship as F1
join Likes as L1
on F1.user2_id=L1.user_id
where F1.user1_id=1 and L1.page_id not in 
(select page_id from Likes 
where user_id=1))
union(
Select L2.page_id as recommended_page from Friendship as F2
join Likes as L2
on F2.user1_id=L2.user_id
where F2.user2_id=1 and L2.page_id not in (select page_id from Likes where user_id=1))
```
