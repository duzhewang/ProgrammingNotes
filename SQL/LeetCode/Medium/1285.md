Problem: Find the Start and End Number of Continuous Ranges


MySQL:

```
select min(b.log_id) as start_id, max(b.log_id) as end_id
from (
select log_id, @var:=if (log_id=@num+1, @var+1, 1) as var,
@num:=log_id as num from Logs,
(select @var :=0, @num:=0) a
) b
group by b.log_id-b.var;
```


SQL:

```

Select L3.Log_id as Start_id, min(L4.log_id) as End_id from Logs as L3, Logs as L4
where L3.Log_id not in 
(Select L2.log_id as endpoint from Logs as L1
join Logs as L2
on L1.log_id+1=L2.log_id) 
and L4.log_id not in 
(Select L1.log_id as startpoint from Logs as L1
join Logs as L2
on L1.log_id+1=L2.log_id)
and L3.Log_id<=L4.Log_id
group by L3.Log_id; 

```
