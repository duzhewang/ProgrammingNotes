Problem: [Active users](https://leetcode.com/problems/active-users/)

MySQL:

```
Select distinct A.id, Acc.name from 
(select id, login_date,
lead(login_date,4) over (partition by id order by login_date) as lead_date
from 
(select distinct id, login_date from Logins) as B
) as A
join Accounts as Acc
on A.id=Acc.id
where A.lead_date=ADDDATE(A.login_date, interval 4 day)
order by A.id; 

```

- Key idea: use window function `lead`: https://www.sqlservertutorial.net/sql-server-window-functions/sql-server-lead-function/



- Another MySQL method:

```
Select distinct T.id, A.name  from 
(Select L1.id from Logins as L1, Logins as L2, Logins as L3, Logins as L4, Logins as L5
where L1.id=L2.id and L2.id=L3.id and L3.id=L4.id and L4.id=L5.id
and Datediff(L2.login_date, L1.login_date)=1 and Datediff(L3.login_date, L2.login_date)=1 
and Datediff(L4.login_date, L3.login_date)=1 and Datediff(L5.login_date, L4.login_date)=1) as T
join Accounts as A
on T.id=A.id
order by T.id asc; 



```
