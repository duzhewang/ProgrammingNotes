Problem: Investments in 2016

MySQL:

```
SELECT SUM(i1.TIV_2016) AS TIV_2016 FROM insurance AS i1
WHERE EXISTS (SELECT i2.PID FROM insurance AS i2 
              WHERE i2.PID <> i1.PID AND i2.TIV_2015 = i1.TIV_2015) AND
(i1.LAT, i1.LON) NOT IN (SELECT LAT, LON FROM insurance GROUP BY LAT, LON HAVING COUNT(*) > 1);


```

```
Select round(sum(TIV_2016),2) as TIV_2016 from insurance
where TIV_2015 in (select TIV_2015 from insurance 
                  group by TIV_2015
                  having count(TIV_2015)>1)
and (LAT, LON) in (select LAT, LON from insurance
                  group by LAT, LON
                  having count(*)=1);                   ;
