Problem: Shortest Distance in a Plane

MySQL:

```
Select MIN(ROUND(SQRT(POWER(y2-y1,2) + POWER(x2-x1,2)),2)) AS 'shortest' from 
(SELECT a.x as 'x1', a.y as 'y1', b.x as 'x2', b.y as 'y2' 
FROM point_2d a
JOIN point_2d b ON (b.x!=a.x OR b.y!=a.y) ) as T
```


```
Select min(round(sqrt(power(p1.x-p2.x, 2)+power(p1.y-p2.y, 2)),2)) as shortest from point_2d as p1, point_2d as p2
where (p1.x, p1.y)<>(p2.x, p2.y);  


```
